When I worked at Miniclip we had a social animation community called Sketch Star. This included a Flash app, and a gallery of animations, with competitions, awards, user accounts, and all sorts. It was a fantastic app with a passionate community but it was expensive to run and didn't earn enough to justify the expense. Shortly after we shut it down I asked if I could release my own version written in JavaScript.

It took me about 5 years of noodling and procrastinating to actually finish something and release it, and that something was Brush Ninja. The app was a lot simpler than Sketch Star and there was no social aspect, but this has kept the costs down.
