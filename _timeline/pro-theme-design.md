[Pro Theme Design](https://prothemedesign.com) is a premium WordPress themes shop. In 2007 I joined forces with Darren Hoyt to create one of the first premium WordPress magazine themes. In early 2008 we released [Mimbo Pro](https://prothemedesign.com/theme/mimbopro/) to the world.

Mimbo Pro included a number of innovations - one of which was the use of featured images that automatically resized using a php script called [TimThumb](https://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2014/09/timthumb-end-life/). That script had a whole story of it's own but it lead to the addition of featured images in WordPress.

In April 2012 I had the first of our themes published on wordpress.com. I now have more than 20 themes available on wordpress.com making Pro Theme Design the most prolific theme author on the site.
