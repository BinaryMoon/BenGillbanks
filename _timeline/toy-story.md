This might not sound like an important thing - but watching the trailer for Toy Story (not the movie, the trailer), was a turning point in my life. I had always enjoyed doing creative things but it was then I decided I wanted to work in 3d art and animation for a living. Things turned out a little different but it was this event that set me on the path to studying digital arts at university.
