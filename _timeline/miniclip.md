I joined Miniclip in 2004 as a multimedia artist; to help them to make games look nice. At the time Miniclip was tiny, I was employee number 3, so we all chipped in and did a bit of everything. So I did everything from creating animations, game icons, and promotional content, through to web design, and even customer support.

Eventually they learnt that I was interested in web design so I spent more and more of my time doing that, until I eventually became the Director of Web Development; managing a team of over 20 web designers and PHP programmers.

In 2013 (ish) I decided I didn't enjoy being a manager so I took a step backwards and moved into a senior development role - looking at the future of the Miniclip website, and testing new designs and innovations that could help to move it forward. My last big project at Miniclip was a redesign project which is still (largely) in use today.
