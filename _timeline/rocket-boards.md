Rocket Boards was my first experience of making a complete shareware video game. It wasn't my first game, but it was the first time I had tried to make money from games.

Rocket Boards is a 3d racing game - inspired by games like Mario Kart. I think I bit off more than I could chew. I had never made anything as complex as this before and it took a lot longer to make than I imagined. But I did finish it in the end and I sold it to a publisher - so people could actually buy it in the shops! The publisher paid me Â£4000, and I earned a few hundred extra selling it through my website.

The biggest thing I got from it, however, was the job at Miniclip. It was never said outright but I am confident that if I didn't have Rocket Boards in my portfolio I wouldn't have gotten the Miniclip job, and so I wouldn't be where I am today.
