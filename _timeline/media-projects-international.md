Whilst at university I was asked if I wanted to apply for a job at a digital agency working on the worlds first 'e-mall'. The concept was to make an interactive shopping center with exhibits that would encourage people to spend more money, and to return frequently.

Whilst on this project I did 3d art for 2 main projects. One was a dancing robot app - that let people put their faces on a robot and then boogey to the music. The other was a fish based virtual pet that let you feed your electronic fish each time you visited the shopping center.
