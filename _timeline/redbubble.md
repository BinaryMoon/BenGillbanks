I love creating things, and generative art is a great way for me to combine the joy of pixel art and the surprise (and automation) created by computers. Generative art is the act of using code to create pictures. I've written a bit about [my process creating genrative art with PHP on my personal site](https://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2021/09/creating-generative-art-with-php/).
