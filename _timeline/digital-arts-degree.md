In 1998 I went to university to study Digital Art with multimedia computing. I graduated in 2001 with a first class honors degree.

The course was very broad covering everything from Photoshop and web design through sound editing, video game development, computer programming, and special effects. Each year we were able to tailor the course a little more towards what we wanted to do as a career. In my final year I was focused on 3d art and video games - since that's where my passions lay.

My end of course project was an interactive 3d walkthrough of the British Museum showing some of the exhibits, and it was displayed at the British Museum.
